### About Me
Hello! I'm Mehmet Fatih, a high school senior currently exploring the world of software development. I have a keen interest in coding and have experience with C# (both console and forms with Selenium). My knowledge extends to basic HTML, and I have a bit of experience with CSS.
As of now, I don't have a team or a group, but I'm open to collaboration and eager to expand my network. Feel free to connect with me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mfatiih__) at mfatiih__
